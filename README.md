# ü¶é `NewtCode` Chocolate Box

A collection of configuration files, templates, and scripts for maintaining consistent
Git repository structure, formatting, and behavior across all projects.

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains my preferred settings and tools for working with Git and project files.
It provides a unified baseline for code style, text normalization, and automation of common checks,
making repositories clean, predictable, and easy to maintain.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Included Configurations

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `.gitignore` | Specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. |
| `.gitattributes` | Ensures consistent text normalization (LF endings), defines diff rules, and marks binary files. |
| `settings/.editorconfig` | Defines indentation, line endings, and encoding rules for all file types to maintain consistent formatting in editors. |
| `settings/Sublime_Text/Preferences.sublime-settings` | Sublime Text editor preferences, e.g., tabs vs spaces, font size, line endings, and other editor behaviors. |
| `settings/VS_Code/settings.json` | VS Code editor settings, such as formatting rules, extensions configuration, and editor behavior. |
